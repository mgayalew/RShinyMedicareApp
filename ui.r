The data displayed here shows average spending levels during hospitalsâ€™ Medicare Spending per Beneficiary (MSPB) episodes. An MSPB episode includes all Medicare Part A and Part B claims paid during the period from 3 days prior to a hospital admission through 30 days after discharge. These average Medicare payment amounts have been price-standardized to remove the effect of geographic payment differences and add-on payments for indirect medical education (IME) and disproportionate share hospitals (DSH)."),

  p("The following scatter plot helps to visualize Medicare average spending per episode among different providers. You can explore average spending within each state for a given period and type of claim by selecting the state from the drop-down box, and period and claim type from the radio buttons. Summary statistics of average spending for a given selection is provided on the top of the application, followed by scatter plot of average spending. Provider with highest average spending are listed under the scatter plot. You can see the name of provider and the average spending by hovering the cursor on each observation. In summary the top ten highest average spending was for inpatient claims during index hospital admission in the state of Texas (3 providers), Ohio, Nebraska, Indiana, Kansas (each 1 provider) and Oklahoma (2 provider)."),
